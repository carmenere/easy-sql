# Collation
**Collation** is the assembly of written information into a **standard order**.<br>

Many systems of collation are based on **numerical order** or **alphabetical order**, or extensions and combinations thereof. <br>

The **Unicode collation algorithm** (**UCA**) is an algorithm defined in **Unicode Technical Report #10**, which is a customizable method to produce binary keys from strings representing text in any writing system and language that can be represented with Unicode.<br>

These keys can then be efficiently byte-by-byte compared in order to collate or sort them according to the rules of the language, with options for ignoring case, accents, etc.
